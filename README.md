## Prepare the preprocess the data

Use the notebook ```generate_dataset_and_preprocess.ipynb```

## Run the pipeline

Use the script ```run_full_cycle_2step.py```


### Other comments

The folder ```full_cycle_scripts``` contains alternate versions of the ```run_full_cycle_2step.py``` script that were used in the supplementary optimal transport studies (https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.06155).
